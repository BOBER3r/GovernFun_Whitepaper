## Preliminary Note

This white paper is a draft and does not represent the final version of the GovernFun project documentation. The content, features, and specifications described herein are subject to change as the project evolves. We welcome feedback from users and the community to help refine and improve future versions of this document and the GovernFun platform.

## Abstract

GovernFun is a Solana-based platform designed to simplify the creation and management of governance and utility tokens. By offering customizable features such as token registration, governance systems, staking mechanisms, and a fee-based incentive structure, GovernFun enables communities to build decentralized ecosystems tailored to their needs. With additional Polymarket-inspired voting logic, GovernFun enhances community engagement and decision-making, providing a flexible and secure framework for token creators and users.

## 1. Introduction

The rise of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based communities has underscored the need for accessible and customizable governance solutions. GovernFun addresses this demand by providing a user-friendly platform for creating governance and utility tokens on the Solana blockchain. With features like token registration, staking, governance, and Polymarket-like prediction market voting, GovernFun empowers creators to build vibrant, engaged communities with robust decision-making systems.

## 2. Project Overview

GovernFun is a Solana-based protocol that allows anyone to create and manage governance and utility tokens with customizable features. Built on Solana's high-performance blockchain, GovernFun ensures low-cost transactions and scalability, making it ideal for communities of all sizes. The platform's modular design allows token creators to enable or disable features such as staking, governance, or advanced voting mechanisms, tailoring tokens to specific use cases.

## 3. Core Features

GovernFun offers a comprehensive suite of features to support token creation, governance, and community engagement. These features are designed to be modular, allowing creators to customize their token's functionality.

### 3.1 Token Registration and Metadata

- **Registration**: Tokens can be registered with essential details, including name, symbol, and launch timestamp (`register_community_token`).
- **Metadata Storage**: Off-chain metadata, such as project descriptions or images, can be stored on decentralized platforms like IPFS or Arweave via a metadata URI (`add_token_metadata`).
- **Ownership Verification**: The platform verifies token ownership to ensure only authorized users can perform specific actions (`verify_token_ownership`).

### 3.2 Fee System

- **1% Transaction Fee**: A 1% fee is applied to key actions, including registration, staking, voting, and proposal creation (`calculate_fee`).
- **Fee Distribution**: Fees are split with 70% allocated to a protocol fee collector and 30% directed to staking rewards (`calculate_protocol_fee`, `calculate_staking_reward`).
- **Configurable Fee Collector**: Admins can set and update a program-wide fee collector address (`initialize_program_config`, `update_fee_collector`).

### 3.3 Governance System

- **Governance Initialization**: Token creators can enable governance with customizable settings, such as voting periods, minimum vote thresholds, and proposal requirements (`initialize_governance`).
- **Multi-Choice Proposals**: Users can create proposals with up to 10 choices, requiring minimum token holdings and a percentage of total supply (`create_multi_choice_proposal`).
- **Proposal Execution**: Successful proposals meeting vote thresholds can trigger actions like updating settings or adding moderators (`execute_proposal`).
- **Escrow for Voting**: Tokens are locked in escrow during voting, with winning escrow tokens transferred to the token creator and losing escrow tokens (after a 1% fee) sent to the staking pool (`distribute_winning_escrow`, `refund_losing_escrow`).

### 3.4 Staking System

- **Staking Pool**: Users can stake tokens with a minimum of 100 tokens and a 1-month lockup period (`initialize_staking_pool`, `stake_tokens`).
- **Rewards Distribution**: 50% of fees are distributed to a rewards vault, with options for stakers to claim or auto-compound rewards (`distribute_staking_rewards`, `claim_rewards`, `toggle_auto_compound`).
- **Unstaking**: Tokens can be unstaked after the minimum period, with rewards claimed or compounded (`unstake_tokens`).

### 3.5 Voting Power Boost

- **Logarithmic Voting Power**: Staked tokens increase voting power logarithmically, capped at a 3x multiplier, incentivizing long-term staking (`calculate_logarithmic_voting_power`, `lock_tokens_for_choice_with_staking_boost`).

### 3.6 Polymarket-Inspired Voting Logic

GovernFun plans to integrate a Polymarket-like voting system, enabling prediction market-style governance. In this system, users can vote on proposals by locking tokens to predict outcomes, with rewards distributed based on the accuracy of their predictions. This mechanism mirrors Polymarket's approach, where participants stake assets on predicted outcomes, and correct predictions earn rewards proportional to their stake. In GovernFun, this feature will:

- Allow token holders to lock tokens on one or more proposal choices, with voting power boosted by staking.
- Distribute rewards from the staking pool or fees to users who correctly predict the winning proposal outcome.
- Be fully customizable, enabling token creators to enable or disable prediction market voting, set reward structures, and adjust voting periods.

This system enhances engagement by aligning incentives with accurate governance decisions, making voting both strategic and rewarding.

### 3.7 Program Configuration

- **Admin Control**: Admins can initialize and update program settings, including the fee collector address (`initialize_program_config`, `update_fee_collector`).

### 3.8 Security and Access Control

- **Authority Checks**: Only authorized accounts (e.g., token creators or governance authorities) can perform critical actions.
- **Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Secure management of escrow and staking vaults ensures trustless operation.

## 4. Technical Architecture

GovernFun is built on Solana, leveraging its high throughput and low transaction costs. The platform uses program-derived addresses (PDAs) for secure state management and employs Rust-based smart contracts for efficiency. Key functions, such as `initialize_governance` and `create_multi_choice_proposal`, are implemented as Solana program instructions, ensuring modularity and scalability.

## 5. Customization and Flexibility

GovernFun's modular design allows token creators to tailor features to their community's needs. For example:

- Creators can enable governance with or without staking.
- Voting can use standard majority-based systems or Polymarket-inspired prediction markets.
- Staking rewards can be customized, with options for auto-compounding or manual claiming.

This flexibility ensures GovernFun supports diverse use cases, from community-driven DAOs to utility-driven dApps.

## 6. Use Cases

- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Communities can create tokens with governance and staking to manage proposals and reward participation.
- **Community Engagement Platforms**: Projects can use GovernFun to incentivize user participation through voting and staking rewards.
- **Prediction Markets**: Polymarket-like voting enables communities to make strategic decisions with financial incentives.

## 7. Future Roadmap

GovernFun aims to expand its feature set, including:

- Full implementation of Polymarket-inspired voting with customizable reward structures.
- Integration with additional off-chain storage solutions for metadata.
- Enhanced analytics dashboards for token creators to monitor governance and staking activity.
- Token-Gated Features: Development of token-gated functionalities to restrict access to specific platform features, content, or services based on token ownership or minimum holdings, enhancing community exclusivity and engagement.

## 8. Conclusion

GovernFun empowers communities to create and manage governance and utility tokens with ease, leveraging Solana's scalability and performance. With customizable features, a robust fee system, and innovative voting mechanisms like Polymarket-inspired prediction markets, GovernFun is poised to drive the next wave of decentralized governance and community engagement.
